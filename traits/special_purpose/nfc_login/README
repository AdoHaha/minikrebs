# NFC-Login
The nfc-login manager provides a gateway to log into shackspace with an
rfid-card.

# hardware
The current version uses a vfd-lcd and a mr3020 but it should work with all
openwrt-enabled routers with usb.

The NFC-Reader attached is:
    - SCM 3711

# software
- the router uses the rest-interface of user_suppository to check for users and
  logs them either in or out.

pu- shing the button on the wrt-router turns on "refresh" mode which will not
toggle the state of the user, but refresh the login.
